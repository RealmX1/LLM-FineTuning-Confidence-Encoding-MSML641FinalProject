0,12,There is a chance,I'm sure,There is a chance that PLACEHOLDER is true.,I'm sure that PLACEHOLDER is true.,"Sentences 1 and 2 are not comparable, as they use different sentence structures. The first sentence has two clauses separated by a conjunction (there), while the second sentence has only one clause. Therefore, sentence 1 is more confident based on its grammatical structure."
0,13,There is a chance,Definitely,There is a chance that PLACEHOLDER is true.,PLACEHOLDER is definitely true.,"Sentence 2 is more confident because it contains a direct statement of the confidence embedded in PLACEHOLDER. Sentences with indirect statements (like ""There is a chance"") will be given higher confidence scores if they are more specific or more likely to be true.
For example, sentence 1 says there's a chance that PLACEHOLDER is true, but sentence 2 states it directly: ""PLACEHOLDER is definitely true."" The latter sentence has a stronger and more direct statement of the confidence embedded in PLACEHOLDER."

- Sentence 2 has a higher probability of being accurate (based on the use of ""certainly"" and ""positively""). - Sentence 1 uses a different tense (past vs. Present) which can influence the listener's interpretation and understanding. Overall, Sentence 1 is more confident due to its clearer and stronger statement."
0,16,There is a chance,Certainly,There is a chance that PLACEHOLDER is true.,"Certainly, PLACEHOLDER is true.","Sentences 1 and 2 have the same meaning, but sentence 1 is more confident because it contains a direct quote that implies certainty. Here's the explanation:
- Sentence 1 has ""a chance"" (adjectival phrase) embedded in the sentence. - Sentence 2 does not contain any adjective phrases (they are adverbs). This means that sentence 2 is a direct quote and doesn't carry any information about certainty or uncertainty. Hence, sentence 2 is more confident than sentence 1 because it conveys certainty in the speaker's opinion."

0,25,There is a chance,It is clear that,There is a chance that PLACEHOLDER is true.,It is clear that PLACEHOLDER is true.,"Based on the input sentences, sentence 1 is more confident because it conveys a clearer and stronger message. The first sentence uses ""there"" instead of ""it"", while the second sentence uses ""clearly"" instead of ""likely"". Both sentences use ""true"" as a noun phrase, indicating that it is a factual statement. Sentence 2 ends with a strong emphatic verb (""is"") and emphasizes the certainty or definitiveness of the statement. Therefore, sentence 1 is more confident than sentence 2.

In this example, sentence 1 has a higher confidence score, since the percentage is greater than 50%."
0,27,There is a chance,Probably,There is a chance that PLACEHOLDER is true.,It is probably true that PLACEHOLDER is true.,"Based on the given input and expected outputs, sentence 2 is more confident as it has a high confidence level in the first sentence (result = 1)."
0,28,There is a chance,It appears that,There is a chance that PLACEHOLDER is true.,It appears that PLACEHOLDER is true.,"Sentence 2 is more confident since it has more specific information, such as ""appears"" instead of ""is"". The sentence ""It appears that PLACEHOLDER is true."" also includes a prepositional phrase indicating where the statement is found (in this case, ""appears""). This makes it sound more certain."
0,29,There is a chance,I'd say,There is a chance that PLACEHOLDER is true.,I'd say PLACEHOLDER is true.,"Sentence 1 is more confident, as it has a higher probability of being true. Result = 1

If you want to compare them based on their confident expressions, you need to use a separate function that compares the confidence of two sentences using a scoring system. In this case, we would define the following scoring function:

```
def score_sentences(sentence1, sentence2):
    return (sentence1.confidence() > sentence2.confidence()) * 2 + (-sentence1.confidence() - sentence2.confidence())

score = score_sentences(sentence1, sentence2)
print(f""Sentence 1 is more confident: {score}"") ```

In this function, we first calculate the confidence of each sentence using the `confidence()` method on both sentences. Then we use a binary operator (`*`) to multiply the scores and add 1 for an even score, or `-` for a difference in confidence. Finally, we return the result as a boolean value."
33,21,To the best of my knowledge,Assuredly,"To the best of my knowledge, PLACEHOLDER is true.","Assuredly, PLACEHOLDER is true.","Output:
Sentence 1 is more confident. result = 1

Explanation:
The difference in confidence is that sentence 2 uses certainty instead of certain and has a stronger emphasis on factuality. Sentence 1 uses knowledge as a strong emphatic statement, which makes it more likely to be considered true."
33,22,To the best of my knowledge,Absolutely,"To the best of my knowledge, PLACEHOLDER is true.","Absolutely, PLACEHOLDER is true.",Both sentences have the same confident information embedded in them (absolutely and truly) but sentence 1 has the higher confidence score due to more specific language in the first sentence.

33,25,To the best of my knowledge,It is clear that,"To the best of my knowledge, PLACEHOLDER is true.",It is clear that PLACEHOLDER is true.,"Sentences 1 and 2 are equivalent in their meaning and have no difference in confidence. The result for sentence 1 will be 0, and sentence 2 will be 0."
33,26,To the best of my knowledge,Chances are,"To the best of my knowledge, PLACEHOLDER is true.",Chances are PLACEHOLDER is true.,"Sentence 1 is more confident than Sentence 2 because it contains a more specific and concrete claim, which implies that there is a high probability of the statement being true.

However, we can still compare the confidence embedded in each sentence by using the text similarity algorithm as follows:

1. Calculate the cosine similarity between the two sentences using PyTorch's Distance function: `cos(x1, x2) = (x1 - x2).^2 / (norm(x1) * norm(x2))`

2. Sort the sentence 1 and sentence 2 by their cosine similarity in descending order (i.e., highest to lowest): `sorted_sentences = sorted([x for x in zip(sentence1, sentence2)], key=lambda pair: pair[1])`

3. Calculate the confidence score of each sentence based on the position of the sentence in the sorted list: `score1 = float(""inf"") if len(sorted_sentences) == 0 else sorted_sentences[-1][0]` and `score2 = float(""inf"") if len(sorted_sentences) == 0 else sorted_sentences[0][0]`

4. Compare the scores: `score1 > score2` if score1 is greater than or equal to score2, else `score1 < score2`
